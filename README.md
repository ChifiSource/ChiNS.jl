###### chifi name server
`ChiNS` is a [toolips](https://github.com/ChifiSource/Toolips.jl)-powered UDP DNS server for julia.
##### map
- [setup]()
- [zones]()
  - [zone directory](#zone-directory)

#### setup
To get started with `chiNS` you will need to add the package via `Pkg`.
```julia
using Pkg; Pkg.add("ChiNS")
```
Once added, there is still more work to do. In order to bind to UDP port 53, you are going to need priveleges to do so. The [ToolipsUDP](https://github.com/ChifiSource/ToolipsUDP.jl) server will **not** start if you do not have these priveleges. Secondly, port 53 (UDP) will need to be allowed outgoing traffic by your firewall service. Here is an example using `firewalld` on Fedora 39:
```julia
sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=53/udp
```
On Ubuntu (ubuntu firewall), as another example...
```julia
ufw allow 53
```
Once this is complete, you should be able to call `ChiNS.start()` to start the server.
#### zones
The `ChiNS` server uses `.zone` files to determine the current names being hosted by the server and where those names should go. When loading `ChiNS`, the server will search for the directory `zones`. If no directory is found, you will be notified to use `set_zones` to set the zone directory. For convenience, `ChiNS` also provides an editor for creating, managing, and editing these zones. Zones are loaded into the server on startup, and may be refeshed with `ChiNS.reload`.
